1. What is the actual role of the meta team?
- Meta team is supposed to be more of a facilitator where the members of the meta team will be members of different functional teams themselves.
- Meta team will not really be a decision making body or would not have ownership on other teams but will act as an arbitration committee. The function teams will be operating independently without any kind of hindrance from the meta team. But they can always take the advice from the meta team. Plus Meta team will be available if they need any help.

2. What is the Provisional Meta team working on?
Currently the Provisional Meta team is helping create the restructure. It is a temporary structure that will dissolve once the actual meta team is formed. Some of the members might remain in the actual meta team as well.


3. I am not sure how to decide which team I want to be a part of. How I can I become part of a functional or any other team?
- It totally depends on your interest.
- If youâ€™re interested to contribute to any particular product of Mozilla or get associated with any particular activity then you can join that particular functional team.
- If something new comes up and you want to be part of that activity, you can either create a focus team or be part of an existing one. Please remember Focus teams are always temporary.
There is a going to be a Meta team which will support (check question #1 for more) other teams on a regular basis. If you want to provide that kind of support, please be part of the Meta team.

4. How do I join any team I am interested about?
- Each team page will list some of the most active members. There will be a form for so that you can apply to be part of that team.

5. Can I switch teams if I do not like a functional team?
- If you can spare more time and contribute in multiple projects, there is nothing like that. And you knows about balancing your time better than anyone else.
